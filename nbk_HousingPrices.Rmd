#High Charts wont appear in a notebook as is, so I need to embed it in a Shiny Page

fluidPage(
  fluidRow(
    h
  )
)

```

# Outliers

```{r}
plot_ly(type="scatter"
        ,x=data.train$GrLivArea
        ,y=data.train$SalePrice)

```

```{r Rmv_Outliers, eval=TRUE}
anchor.train <- data.train %>% filter(GrLivArea < 4600)

plot_ly(anchor.train, type="scatter",x=~GrLivArea, y=~SalePrice)

```

# Skewness

Sale Price is the target/response variable, so let's do a little analysis on it.

```{r Density_Plot, eval=TRUE}
h1 <- hchart(density(anchor.train$SalePrice),type="area",color="red", name="Sale Price")
h2 <- hchart(density(log(anchor.train$SalePrice)),type="area",color="blue",name="Log of Sale Price")

fluidPage(
  fluidRow(column(6,h1)
           ,column(6,h2))
)
```

We can see that Sale Price is skewed, where as the log transform of the Sale Price looks to be more normally distributed.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(anchor.train, aes(sample=SalePrice)) + 
  stat_qq(colour="red") + 
  stat_qq_line(colour="blue",size=1.5) + 
  ggtitle("Normal Q-Q Plot: Sale Price")

p2 <- ggplot(anchor.train, aes(sample=log(SalePrice))) + 
  stat_qq(colour="red") + 
  stat_qq_line(colour="blue",size=1.5) + 
  ggtitle("Normal Q-Q Plot: Log of Sale Price")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

Looking at the QQ Plot, we can confirm that the transform is definitely more normally distributed.

# Feature Engineering

## Missing Values?

### Background

It seems that the general consensus is that there is no good way to handle missing values.  There may be instances where leaving the data row out when it has values missing will be a good choice, however, you might be still depriving the dataset of valuable information.  On the flip side, depending on how you impute the missing data, you may be introducing bias into the data.  

In general, missing values can be bucketed into 3 categories:

  1.  **Missing at Random (MAR):**  Data points that are missing not related to the missing data, but related to some of the observed data.
  2.  **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR):**  Missing data has nothing to do with the hypothesis or values of the other variables.
  3.  **Missing not at Random (MNAR):**  Missing value is dependent on some hypothetical value or dependent on some other variable.

In cases 1 & 2, it is safe to delete the data with the missing values, dependent on the occurrences.  However,in case 3, removing the data can introduce bias into the model.

>*Note: Imputation does not necessarily mean better results*

### Imputing Missing Data: Categorical vs Numerical

Categorical:
  1.  Mode Imputation, but it will definitely introduce bias
  2.  Missing values can be treated as a separate category, which is the simplest method
  3.  Prediction models.  Here you divide the data into 2 sets: one with no missing values (train) and the data with missing values (test).  Then use logistic regression or ANOVA for prediction.
  4.  Multiple Imputation

Numerical:
  1.  Mean, Mode, Median: Disadvantage is that it reduces the variance of the data
  2.  Linear Regression:  Use the complete cases to build a regression model to predict the missing values.  The disadvantages is that the predicted values fit together "too well" and standard error is deflated.  One is also assuming there is a linear relationship between variables, which there may not be one.
  3.  KNN:  It's simple to understand and easy to implement.  The non-parametric nature of KNN gives it an advantage where data may be highly "unusual".  Disadvantage is that analyzing large data sets can be time consuming.  Also, KNN be severly degraded with high dimensionality as there is little difference between the nearest and farthest neighbors.
  4.  Multiple Imputation:  More detail below

### Multiple Imputation

Multiple imputation is a statistical technique for analyzing incomplete data sets, that is, data sets for which some entries are missing. Application of the technique requires three steps: imputation, analysis and pooling. The figure illustrates these steps.

  1.  **Imputation:** Impute (=fill in) the missing entries of the incomplete data sets, not once, but m times (m=3 in the figure). Imputed values are drawn for a distribution (that can be different for each missing entry). This step results is m complete data sets. 
  2.  **Analysis:** Analyze each of the m completed data sets. This step results in m analyses.
  3.  **Pooling:** Integrate the m analysis results into a final result. Simple rules exist for combining the m analyses.

![*Imputation Diagram*](C:/Zeno/R/House Prices/Imputation.png)

There are numerous ways to do the multiple imputation.  From the `mice` package, we have the following methods.  

```{r}
methods(mice)
```

% of data that is NULL/NA by column
```{r}
#sapply(data.train,function(x) sum(x=="NULL"))  # Use when Null
round(sapply(anchor.train,function(x) sum(is.na(x))) / nrow(anchor.train) * 100,digits=3)   # Use when NA
```

Some of the variables 

**Make a copy of the original dataset**

```{r rmv_Nulls, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# We remove SalePrice because we don't want the One Hot Encoding to consider it as a feature
response.train <- log(anchor.train$SalePrice)

#Copy the Train Data and separate out the response variable
anchor.train <- anchor.train %>% dplyr::select(-SalePrice) #, -Alley, -PoolQC, -Fence, -MiscFeature, -FireplaceQu)

anchor.test <- data.test # %>% select(-Alley, -PoolQC, -Fence, -MiscFeature, -FireplaceQu)

anchor <- rbind(anchor.train, anchor.test)

```

Now we need to separate out the Numeric vs Categorical variables.  We do need to understand the variables as MBSubClass looks like a numerical variable, but closer inspection shows that the integer values simply represent a housing type.  We do not want the Machine Learning model to assume there is an inherent ranking with those values.  We'll need to include them in the One-Hot Encoding.

```{r Feature_Types, eval=TRUE}
features <- sapply(anchor.train,typeof)

features.category <- names(features[features == "character"])
features.numeric <- names(features[features != "character"])
features.numeric <- features.numeric[features.numeric != "MSSubClass"]

features.category[length(features.category)+1] <- "MSSubClass"
features.category[length(features.category)+1] <- "Id"

anchor.train <- anchor.train %>% mutate(MSSubClass=as.character(MSSubClass))
anchor.test <- anchor.test %>% mutate(MSSubClass=as.character(MSSubClass))

```


## Imputation of Categorical Data {.tabset}

anchor.train$YrSold <- as.character(anchor.train$YrSold)
anchor.train$MoSold <- as.character(anchor.train$MoSold)

anchor.test$YrSold <- as.character(anchor.test$YrSold)

#anchor.test$OverallCond <- as.character(anchor.test$OverallCond)

#anchor.train %>% group_by(OverallQual, OverallCond) %>% summarize(Count=n())

```


## Imputation of Numerical Data {.tabset}

We are starting with the **Predictive Mean Matching** method.  This is a semi-parametric appraoch that fills in the missing values by randomly selecting from the observed donor values from an observation whose regression-predicted values are closest to the regression-predicted value for the missing value from the simulated regression model.  This ensures that the imputed values are plausible.

```{r}
# Find all Categorical Variables that have missing values
sapply(anchor.train[features.numeric], function(x) sum(is.na(x))) != 0
```

```{r}
aggr_plot <- aggr(anchor.train[c("LotFrontage","MasVnrArea","GarageYrBlt")], col=c('navyblue','red'), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(data), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c("Histogram of missing data","Pattern"))
```


### LotFrontage

```{r}

imp.train <- mice(anchor.train[c("LotFrontage","MasVnrArea","GarageYrBlt")]
     ,method="pmm"
     ,m=5
     ,maxit=50
     ,seed=1212)

imp.test <- mice(anchor.test[c("LotFrontage","MasVnrArea","GarageYrBlt")]
     ,method="pmm"
     ,m=5
     ,maxit=50
     ,seed=1587)

```

```{r}

imp.train$imp$LotFrontage

imp.train$imp$LotFrontage

imp$imp$LotFrontage

imp$imp$GarageYrBlt
```

```{r}
imp.train.completed <- complete(imp.train)
imp.test.completed <- complete(imp.test)
```

Replace the original columns with the imputed ones and check to see if there are anymore NA's.

```{r}

anchor.train <- anchor.train %>% dplyr::select(-LotFrontage, -GarageYrBlt, -MasVnrArea)
anchor.train <- cbind(anchor.train, imp.train.completed)

anchor.test <- anchor.test %>% dplyr::select(-LotFrontage, -GarageYrBlt, -MasVnrArea)
anchor.test <- cbind(anchor.test, imp.test.completed)

colnames(anchor.test)
sapply(anchor.train, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

```{r}
anchor.test %>% dplyr::select(LotFrontage)
```


### BsmtFinSF1 & BsmtFinSF2

Based on the definition, it appears that if a basement has multiple finishes, it uses a 2nd variable to track the square footage of the next finish.  If you do not combine these variables, you don't have an apples to apples comparison to homes with a single basement finish

```{r}

anchor.train %>% select(BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2)

anchor.train$BsmtTotalSF <- anchor.train$BsmtFinSF1 + anchor.train$BsmtFinSF2
anchor.test$BsmtTotalSF <- anchor.test$BsmtFinSF1 + anchor.test$BsmtFinSF2

anchor.train <- anchor.train %>% dplyr::select(-BsmtFinSF1, -BsmtFinSF2)
anchor.test <- anchor.test %>% dplyr::select(-BsmtFinSF1, -BsmtFinSF2)

features.numeric <- features.numeric[features.numeric != "BsmtFinSF1"]
features.numeric <- features.numeric[features.numeric != "BsmtFinSF2"]

features.numeric[length(features.numeric)+1] <- "BsmtTotalSF"

```

### Skewed Features

```{r}

fluidPage(
  fluidRow(hchart(density(anchor.train$GrLivArea),type="area",color="red", name="General Living Area"))
)

skewed_features <- sapply(features.numeric,function(x) {
  skewness(anchor.train[[x]],na.rm=TRUE)
})

# Filter for features with skewness > .75
skewed_features <- skewed_features[abs(skewed_features) > .75]

anchor.test[names(skewed_features)]

names(skewed_features)

# Perform a Box-Cox transformation on the skewed variables
for (x in names(skewed_features)) {
  bc.train <- BoxCoxTrans(anchor.train[[x]], lambda=.15)
  anchor.train[[x]] <- predict(bc.train, anchor.train[[x]])
  
  bc.test <- BoxCoxTrans(anchor.test[[x]], lambda=.15)
  anchor.test[[x]] <- predict(bc.test, anchor.test[[x]])
}

fluidPage(
  fluidRow(hchart(density(test2),type="area",color="red", name="General Living Area"))
)

```

## Inherent Rankings

Features about quality of a product has an inherent ranking to it.  Poor, satisfactory, good have a rank order that we want to preserve in the model.

        anchor.test[, c] = as.numeric(factor(anchor.test[, c]))
    } else {
      anchor.train[, c] = as.numeric(factor(anchor.train[, c], levels = levels[[i]]))
      anchor.test[, c] = as.numeric(factor(anchor.test[, c], levels = levels[[i]]))
    }

    i = i + 1
}

```


There are over 70 variables in the data set.  I want a more systematic approach to determine which variables I should be exploring deeper and including in the final model.

## Boruta Algorithm

**What is Boruta?**

It is a wrapper approach built around a random forest.  In a wrapper method, the classifier is used as a black box returning a feature ranking.  It is an ensemble method in which classification is performed by voting of multiple unbiased weak classifiers - decision trees.  These trees are independently developed on different bagging samples of the training set.

The importance measure of an attribute is obtained as the loss of accuracy classification caused by the random permutation of attribute values between objects.

**Boruta vs. Random Forest**

Boruta is supposed to be an improvement over Random Forest variable importance.  It uses randomization on top of results obtained from variable importance obtained from Random Forest to determine the truly important and statistically valid results.

**How does Boruta work?**

1.  Adds randomness to the given data set by creating shuffled copies of all features (which are called shadow features)
2.  Trains a random forest classifier on the extended data set and applies a feature importance measure (default is Mean Decrease Accuracy) to evaluate the importance of each feature where higher means more important
3.  At every iteration, it checks whether a real feature has a higher importance than the best of its shadow features (i.e. whether the feature has a higher Z score than the maximum Z score of its shadow features) and constantly removes features that are deemed highly unimportant
4.  Algorithm stops either when all features gets confirmed or rejected or it reaches a specified limit of random forest runs

**Applications in Insurance/Reinsurance?**

* It could validate model features that are being used.  
* Aid in developing models by subsetting explanatory variables so that a smaller subset is used instead of looking at insignificant variables.

Boruta can't handle Nulls, so we will replace them with "Missing" or "-1" depending on the field type.

```{r Clean_Nulls, eval=TRUE}
# I don't want to taint the original copy of the data
boruta.train <- anchor.train %>% dplyr::select(-Id)

for (x in features.category[features.category != "Id"])
{
  boruta.train[[x]][is.na(boruta.train[[x]])] <- "Missing"
}

for (x in features.numeric[features.numeric != "Id"])
{
  boruta.train[[x]][is.na(boruta.train[[x]])] <- -1
}

```

Summary of the Boruta Analysis
```{r Print Boruta Results, eval=TRUE}
print(bor.results)
```

Plot of the Boruta Analysis
```{r Plot Boruta Results, eval=TRUE}

Let's review the variables

```{r Get Boruta Results, eval=TRUE}
results_df <- data.frame(attStats(bor.results))  #allStats is part of Boruta that summarizes the results into a table

results_df$feature <- factor(row.names(results_df),levels=unique(row.names(results_df))[order(results_df$meanImp,decreasing=FALSE)])

f <- list(
  family = "Courier New, monospace",
  size = 16,
  color = "#7f7f7f"
)

results_df <- results_df %>% arrange(desc(meanImp))

results_df

#write.csv(results_df, paste(dir.data, "Boruta.csv",sep=""))

Some of the "important" variables intuitively makes sense, i.e. General Living Area, Overall Quality, etc.  We will review the variables that seem to be of questionable decision.

# Boosting

## Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

XGBoost is a supervised machine learning technique, where the output is provided.  The **regularization** term is what controls the complexity of the model to prevent overfitting.

In Machine Learning, we talk of the relationship between simplicity and predictability of the model.  The tradeoff is referred to the **bias-variance** tradeoff.

XGBoost is a tree ensemble, which is a set of classification and regression trees (CART).  CART differs from decision trees in that decision trees only provide the decision values, whereas CART provides an associated score with each leaf.

![*CART Example*](C:/Zeno/R/House Prices/twocart.png)

Random forests are also ensemble trees.  The only difference between Random Forests and XG Boost is how the model is trained.  To train the model, XG Boost uses an additive algorithm.  Fix what has been learned and add 1 new tree at a time.

Advantages of XGBoost:

1.  Parallel Computing:  Parallel processing is enabled.  By default, it will use all cores on your machine.
2.  Regularization:  Advtange over GBM package, which does not have regularization.  See Appendix B.
3.  Cross Validation:  Though there are packages out there to handle cross validation, xgboost has an internal CV function.
4.  Missing Values:  XGBoost handles missing values internally.  If missing values have a pattern, it will be captured by the model.
5.  Flexibility:  In addition to regression, classification and ranking problems, you can define custom objective functions.  It also supports user defined evaluation metrics.  
6.  Availability:  It's available in R, Python, Java, Julia and Scala.
7.  Save and Reload:  You can save the model and reload it.  
8.  Tree Pruning:  XGBoost continues to grow a tree until the max depth, and then prunes backwards until the improvement on the loss function is below threshold.

For many machine learning algorithms, having highly correlated variables is not a good idea.  It can make predictions less accurate and makes interpreting the model almost impossible.  GLM's for example assume that features are uncorrelated.

Decision tree algorithms, including boosted trees, are very robust to correlated features and one does not have to do anything to manage the correlations.

For Classification problems, trees are grown to reduce misclassification rates in subsequent iterations.  

For Regression problems, it builds a generalized linear model and optimizes it using regularization (L1, L2) and gradient descent.  Subsequent models are built on residuals (Actual - Predicted).  *Gradient Descent* is a method where a vector of weights (or coefficients), we want to minimize the partial derivatives to find the local minima of the RSS.  Simply put, we want to minimize the error by tuning the values of the coefficients.

For regularization, for linear regression we want to minimize the RSS (objective function) and we apply a penalty term to the objective function.  
![*CART Example*](C:/Zeno/R/House Prices/Regularization.png)

Optimizing lambda defines the trade-off between the prediction accuracy of the training sample and prediction accuracy of the hold out sample.

## Utilizing the xgboost package

Description of the parameters for the xgboost package:

### General Parameters
* **booster = "gblinear" or "gbtree":**  allows you to use a linear or classification boosting algorithm
* **nthread = n:**  number of cpu threads to use.  By default it will use the max.
* **silent = 0 or 1:**  1 prints running messages to the console.  Best to keep at 0.

### Parameters for Tree Booster
* **nround = n:** number of passes to make on the data.  Each round will enhance the model by further reducing the difference between the ground truth and prediction.  The more complex the relationship between your features and your label (response variable), the more rounds you will need.  By default it will run 100.
* **eta = 0 - 1:**  By default, it is set to 0.3.  This controls the learning rate, i.e. the rate in which the model learns patterns in data.  After every round, it shrinks the feature weights to reach optimum.  Lower the eta, the slower the computation and must be supported by **nround**.
* **gamma = 0 - inf:**  Controls the regularization.  Higher the value, the higher the regularization.  Default is set to 0, which means no regularization.  As a trick, you can set the gamma to 0 and check the CV error rate.  If the train error >>> test error, bring the gamma into action.  Higher the gamma, the lower the difference between Train and Test CV.  Gamma brings improvement when you want to use shallow trees.
* **max.depth = n:** you can set the max depth of trees.  Larger the depth, higher the chances of overfitting.  This should be tuned with CV.
* **min_child_weight = 0 - inf:**  In Regression, refers to the min number of instances required in a child node.  In Classfication, if the leaf node has a minimum sum of instance weights lower than the min_child_weight, the tree splitting stops.  Basically another feature to prevent overfitting.
* **subsample = 0 - 1:**  controls the number of samples (observations) supplied to a tree.  Typically, this is (0.5,0.8).  Default is 1.
* **colsample_bytree = 0 - 1:** controls the number of features supplied to a tree.  Typically, that is (0.5,0.9).  Default is 1.
* **lambda = 0 or 1:** enables the L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) on weights.  Default is 0
* **alpha = 0 or 1:** enables the L1 regularization (Lasso Regression) on weights.  In addition to shrinkage, alpha also results in feature selection.

### Parameters for Linear Booster
Uses significantly less parameters than the Tree Booster

* **nround = n:** 
* **lambda = 0 or 1:** 
* **alpha = 0 or 1:** 

### Learning Task Parameters

* **objective = (see below):** You can set the objective function.  Here as an example, you can set it as a binary classification model.
  * reg:linear - linear regression
  * binary:logistic - logistic regression for binary classification.  Returns class probabilities
  * multi:softmax - multiclassification using softmax objective.  Returns predicted class labels.  Requires setting num_class parameter denoting number of unique prediction classes.
  * multi:softprob - multiclassification using softmax objective returning predicted class probabilities.
* **eval.metric = (see below):**  metrics used to evaluate model accuracy.  Regression default is RMSE.  Classification default is error.
  * mae - Mean Absolute Error (used in Regression)
  * LogLoss - Negative loglikelihood (used in Classification)
  * AUC - Area under curve (used in Classification)
  * RMSE - Root Mean Square Error (used in Regression)
  * error - Binary classification error rate [# wrong / # total]
  * mlogloss - multiclass logloss (used in Classification)

### Other Parameters
* **verbose = 0,1,2:**  0 is no messages, 1 prints evaluation metric, 2 also prints the information about the tree
* **watchlist = list(train=train,test=test):** allows you to feed a test set into the model so that the model can keep retesting itself on the test set.  This way you can measure the progress of learning.  This will help prevent overfitting and can define a stopping point when the model is optimized and no longer needs any more iterations.

XGBoost produces a regression model.  In a binary classification model, the predictions will be probabilities that range from 0 < p < 1.  To interpret the prediction for the binary classification, you can set the probability to > .5, etc.

For a multiclass classification, the similar concept of assigning a threshold applies.

## Data Preparation for xgboost

xgboost only takes numeric variables.  We will need to convert categorical variables, like state, into a numeric variable that can be fed into xgboost.  We will convert a dense matrix (few zeroes in the matrix) to a sparse matrix (many zeroes in the matrix).

One method is called **one-hot encoding**. It is a respresentation of a categorical variable as a binary vector.

Let's show you an example.  Suppose you have the following sequence:
  'red','red','green'
  
Represented as an integer:

  0,0,1
  
One Hot Encoding Representation would look like:

  [0,1]
  
  [0,1]
  
  [1,0]

But one-hot encoding also presents two problems that are more particular to tree-based models:

* The resulting sparsity virtually ensures that continuous variables are assigned higher feature importance.

* A single level of a categorical variable must meet a very high bar in order to be selected for splitting early in the tree building. This can degrade predictive performance.

*Note:  When possible, it is ideal to use the data.table instead of the data.frame.  data.table is 100% compliant with data.frames and its performance is much better.*

*Note: You will want to either remove the ID field or NULL it out.*

```{r}

#Build Sparse Matrix
data.train.sparse <- explanatory.train[field.attributes$integer]
data.test.sparse <- explanatory.test[field.attributes$integer]

#head(sparse.model.matrix(explanatory.train))

# One Hot Encode Train
for (j in 1:length(field.attributes$character))
{
  print(field.attributes$character[j])
  
  toEncode <- unique(explanatory.train[,field.attributes$character[j]])
  for (i in 1:(length(toEncode)-1))
  {
    data.train.sparse[,paste(field.attributes$character[j],toEncode[i],sep="_")] <- ifelse(explanatory.train[,field.attributes$character[j]] == toEncode[i],1,0)
  }
}

# One Hot Encode Test
for (j in 1:length(field.attributes$character))
{
  toEncode <- unique(explanatory.test[,field.attributes$character[j]])
  for (i in 1:(length(toEncode)-1))
  {
    data.test.sparse[,paste(field.attributes$character[j],toEncode[i],sep="_")] <- ifelse(explanatory.test[,field.attributes$character[j]] == toEncode[i],1,0)
  }
}


#toEncode <- unique(data.train[,field.attributes$character[2]])

#for (i in 1:length(toEncode))
#{
#  data.sparse[,paste(field.attributes$character[2],toEncode[i],sep="_")] <- ifelse(data.train[,field.attributes$character[2]] == toEncode[i],1,0)
#}

#head(data.sparse)

```


# One Hot Encoding

Now that the variables are separated between Numerical and Categorical, we can One-Hot encode the categorical variables.

```{r One_Hot, eval=FALSE}
# First one-hot encode the categorical variables
anchor.train.encoded <- anchor.train[,features.category] %>%
  gather(variable, value, -(Id)) %>%

  mutate(value=1) %>%
  dcast(Id~comb_header)

# If not 1, then it is definitely 0
anchor.train.encoded[is.na(anchor.train.encoded)] <- 0
anchor.train.encoded <- left_join(anchor.train.encoded, anchor.train[features.numeric], by="Id") %>% select(-Id)

#anchor.train.encoded <- subset(anchor.train.encoded, select=-c(Id))

anchor.train.encoded <- cbind(anchor.train.encoded, SalePrice=response.train)

colnames(anchor.train.encoded) <- gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", "_",colnames(anchor.train.encoded))

for(i in 1:ncol(anchor.train.encoded)){
  anchor.train.encoded[is.na(anchor.train.encoded[,i]), i] <- mean(anchor.train.encoded[,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}

# Prep the Test data the same way
anchor.test.encoded <- anchor.test[,features.category] %>%
  gather(variable, value, -(Id)) %>%
  unite(comb_header, variable, value) %>%
  mutate(value=1) %>%
  dcast(Id~comb_header)

# If not 1, then it is definitely 0
anchor.test.encoded[is.na(anchor.test.encoded)] <- 0

anchor.test.encoded <- left_join(anchor.test.encoded, anchor.test[features.numeric], by="Id") %>% select(-Id)

colnames(anchor.test.encoded) <- gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", "_",colnames(anchor.test.encoded))

for(i in 1:ncol(anchor.test.encoded)){
  anchor.test.encoded[is.na(anchor.test.encoded[,i]), i] <- mean(anchor.test.encoded[,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}

anchor.test.encoded$SalePrice <- 0

```

```{r Caret_One_Hot, eval=TRUE}

anchor.train <- anchor.train %>% dplyr::select(-Id)
anchor.test <- anchor.test %>% dplyr::select(-Id)

features.category <- names(features[features == "character"])
features.numeric <- names(features[features != "character"])

dummies <- dummyVars(~.,anchor.train[features.category])
anchor.train.encoded <- predict(dummies,anchor.train[features.category])
colnames(anchor.train.encoded) <- gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", "_",colnames(anchor.train.encoded))

colnames(anchor.test.encoded) <- gsub("[^[:alnum:]]", "_",colnames(anchor.test.encoded))


```


> Predictions from the MLR (and other xgboost packages) cannot make predictions when the columns are not consistent.  i.e. Train and Test must have the same columns used between both datasets.  If not, the output basically defaults to the average for all rows.  Even though it will make accurate predictions on the training set if you feed it back into the model for predictions.

```{r}

colnames(anchor.test.encoded)

anchor.test.encoded[colnames(anchor.train.encoded[!(colnames(anchor.train.encoded) %in% colnames(anchor.test.encoded))])] <- 0

# Error/Loss/Cost Functions

There are times when appropriate Cost/Loss functions are not available in the `xgb` & `mlr` package to evalute the errors/residuals for machine learning.  Fortunately, you can create your own custom error metric to evaluate the residuals.

As discussed in the outlier analysis, the cost function/residuals are important because gradient boosting buildings upon residuals.  

Absolute and Huber Error metrics are supposed to be more robust to outliers than RMSE.  Seeing how 

**Absolute Error**

If the datasets are large and you don't want to spend the time having to retrain the model in the future.  You can save the model.
```{r, eval=FALSE}

xgb.save(model.xgboost,"model.xgboost")

#To Load a Saved Model
model.xgboost2 <-  xgb.load("model.xgboost")

# Correlation Analysis

Unfortunately, the corrplot package only works with Numeric data fields.  To do a correlation analysis on all other variables, we would probably need to run ANOVA tests.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
M <-cor(explanatory[,sapply(explanatory,is.numeric)])
corrplot(M,method="circle")

M <- cor(explanatory.train[,c("GarageCars","GarageArea")])
corrplot(M,method="circle")

#Appendix C.  Preventing Overfitting

There are 4 commonly used methods to prevent overfitting:

1.  Cross-Validation:  Leave one sample out for in-time validation and the rest of the data used for training.

2.  Early Stopping:  Provides guidance on how many iterations before the learner begins to overfit.

3.  Pruning:  Removing nodes which add little predictive power to the model.

4.  Regularization:  Introduces a cost term for bringing more features with the objective function.
