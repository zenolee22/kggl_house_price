#Initialization

Set Libraries
```{r libraries, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(plotly)    # Plots and Graphs
library(Boruta)    # Runs a Boruta Feature Analysis
library(dplyr)     # Data Manipulation
library(corrplot)  # Correlation Plots
library(xgboost)   # Runs Extreme Gradient Boosting
library(Matrix)    # For sparse matrices

```


#Import Data
```{r Data, eval=TRUE}
dir.data <- "W:/Bermuda/Actuarial/SQL Scripts/Kaggle/House Prices/Data/"
data.test <- read.csv(paste(dir.data,"test.csv",sep=""),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data.train <- read.csv(paste(dir.data,"train.csv",sep=""), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
setwd("W:/Bermuda/Actuarial/SQL Scripts/Kaggle/House Prices/")
```


#Exploratory Analysis

```{r}
summary(data.train)
```

```{r}
str(data.train)
```

Same as the histogram.  This is just a frequency count.  Just placed here as reference on how to do a frequency count.
```{r}
data.train %>% group_by(PoolQC) %>% tally()
```

## Missing Values?

% of data that is NULL/NA by column
```{r}
#sapply(data.train,function(x) sum(x=="NULL"))  # Use when Null
round(sapply(data.train,function(x) sum(is.na(x))) / nrow(data.train) * 100,digits=3)   # Use when NA
```

There are some obvious variables that should be excluded from the dataset, i.e. features with > 80% of missing data.  

Alley, PoolQC, Fence, and MiscFeature will be removed as they all have missing values > 80%.  FireplaceQU is questionable as ~50% of the data is missing.  

*Note: Although xgboost should be able to handle the missing values, for efficiency, they should be excluded from further analysis.*

# Feature Engineering

## Boruta Algorithm

**What is Boruta?**

It is a wrapper approach built around a random forest.  In a wrapper method, the classifier is used as a black box returning a feature ranking.  It is an ensemble method in which classification is performed by voting of multiple unbiased weak classifiers - decision trees.  These trees are independently developed on different bagging samples of the training set.

The importance measure of an attribute is obtained as the loss of accuracy classification caused by the random permutation of attribute values between objects.

**Boruta vs. Random Forest**

Boruta is supposed to be an improvement over Random Forest variable importance.  It uses randomization on top of results obtained from variable importance obtained from Random Forest to determine the truly important and statistically valid results.

**How does Boruta work?**

1.  Adds randomness to the given data set by creating shuffled copies of all features (which are called shadow features)
2.  Trains a random forest classifier on the extended data set and applies a feature importance measure (default is Mean Decrease Accuracy) to evaluate the importance of each feature where higher means more important
3.  At every iteration, it checks whether a real feature has a higher importance than the best of its shadow features (i.e. whether the feature has a higher Z score than the maximum Z score of its shadow features) and constantly removes features that are deemed highly unimportant
4.  Algorithm stops either when all features gets confirmed or rejected or it reaches a specified limit of random forest runs


**Applications in Insurance/Reinsurance?**

* It could validate model features that are being used.  
* Aid in developing models by subsetting explanatory variables so that a smaller subset is used instead of looking at insignificant variables.

# Boosting

## Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

XGBoost is a supervised machine learning technique, where the output is provided.  The **regularization** term is what controls the complexity of the model to prevent overfitting.

In Machine Learning, we talk of the relationship between simplicity and predictability of the model.  The tradeoff is referred to the **bias-variance** tradeoff.

XGBoost is a tree ensemble, which is a set of classification and regression trees (CART).  CART differs from decision trees in that decision trees only provide the decision values, whereas CART provides an associated score with each leaf.

![*CART Example*](W:/Bermuda/Actuarial/SQL Scripts/Kaggle/House Prices/twocart.png)

Random forests are also ensemble trees.  The only difference between Random Forests and XG Boost is how the model is trained.  To train the model, XG Boost uses an additive algorithm.  Fix what has been learned and add 1 new tree at a time.

Advantages of XGBoost:

1.  Parallel Computing:  Parallel processing is enabled.  By default, it will use all cores on your machine.
2.  Regularization:  Advtange over GBM package, which does not have regularization.  See Appendix B.
3.  Cross Validation:  Though there are packages out there to handle cross validation, xgboost has an internal CV function.
4.  Missing Values:  XGBoost handles missing values internally.  If missing values have a pattern, it will be captured by the model.
5.  Flexibility:  In addition to regression, classification and ranking problems, you can define custom objective functions.  It also supports user defined evaluation metrics.  
6.  Availability:  It's available in R, Python, Java, Julia and Scala.
7.  Save and Reload:  You can save the model and reload it.  
8.  Tree Pruning:  XGBoost continues to grow a tree until the max depth, and then prunes backwards until the improvement on the loss function is below threshold.

For many machine learning algorithms, having highly correlated variables is not a good idea.  It can make predictions less accurate and makes interpreting the model almost impossible.  GLM's for example assume that features are uncorrelated.

Decision tree algorithms, including boosted trees, are very robust to correlated features and one does not have to do anything to manage the correlations.

For Classification problems, trees are grown to reduce misclassification rates in subsequent iterations.  

For Regression problems, it builds a generalized linear model and optimizes it using regularization (L1, L2) and gradient descent.  Subsequent models are built on residuals (Actual - Predicted).  *Gradient Descent* is a method where a vector of weights (or coefficients), we want to minimize the partial derivatives to find the local minima of the RSS.  Simply put, we want to minimize the error by tuning the values of the coefficients.

## Utilizing the xgboost package

Description of the parameters for the xgboost package:

### General Parameters
* **booster = "gblinear" or "gbtree":**  allows you to use a linear or classification boosting algorithm
* **nthread = n:**  number of cpu threads to use.  By default it will use the max.
* **silent = 0 or 1:**  1 prints running messages to the console.  Best to keep at 0.

### Parameters for Tree Booster
* **nround = n:** number of passes to make on the data.  Each round will enhance the model by further reducing the difference between the ground truth and prediction.  The more complex the relationship between your features and your label (response variable), the more rounds you will need.  By default it will run 100.
* **eta = 0 - 1:**  By default, it is set to 0.3.  This controls the learning rate, i.e. the rate in which the model learns patterns in data.  After every round, it shrinks the feature weights to reach optimum.  Lower the eta, the slower the computation and must be supported by **nround**.
* **gamma = 0 - inf:**  Controls the regularization.  Higher the value, the higher the regularization.  Default is set to 0, which means no regularization.  As a trick, you can set the gamma to 0 and check the CV error rate.  If the train error >>> test error, bring the gamma into action.  Higher the gamma, the lower the difference between Train and Test CV.  Gamma brings improvement when you want to use shallow trees.
* **max.depth = n:** you can set the max depth of trees.  Larger the depth, higher the chances of overfitting.  This should be tuned with CV.
* **min_child_weight = 0 - inf:**  In Regression, refers to the min number of instances required in a child node.  In Classfication, if the leaf node has a minimum sum of instance weights lower than the min_child_weight, the tree splitting stops.  Basically another feature to prevent overfitting.
* **subsample = 0 - 1:**  controls the number of samples (observations) supplied to a tree.  Typically, this is (0.5,0.8).  Default is 1.
* **colsample_bytree = 0 - 1:** controls the number of features supplied to a tree.  Typically, that is (0.5,0.9).  Default is 1.
* **lambda = 0 or 1:** enables the L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) on weights.  Default is 0
* **alpha = 0 or 1:** enables the L1 regularization (Lasso Regression) on weights.  In addition to shrinkage, alpha also results in feature selection.

### Parameters for Linear Booster
Uses significantly less parameters than the Tree Booster

* **nround = n:** 
* **lambda = 0 or 1:** 
* **alpha = 0 or 1:** 

### Learning Task Parameters

* **objective = (see below):** You can set the objective function.  Here as an example, you can set it as a binary classification model.
  * reg:linear - linear regression
  * binary:logistic - logistic regression for binary classification.  Returns class probabilities
  * multi:softmax - multiclassification using softmax objective.  Returns predicted class labels.  Requires setting num_class parameter denoting number of unique prediction classes.
  * multi:softprob - multiclassification using softmax objective returning predicted class probabilities.
* **eval.metric = (see below):**  metrics used to evaluate model accuracy.  Regression default is RMSE.  Classification default is error.
  * mae - Mean Absolute Error (used in Regression)
  * LogLoss - Negative loglikelihood (used in Classification)
  * AUC - Area under curve (used in Classification)
  * RMSE - Root Mean Square Error (used in Regression)
  * error - Binary classification error rate [# wrong / # total]
  * mlogloss - multiclass logloss (used in Classification)

### Other Parameters
* **verbose = 0,1,2:**  0 is no messages, 1 prints evaluation metric, 2 also prints the information about the tree
* **watchlist = list(train=train,test=test):** allows you to feed a test set into the model so that the model can keep retesting itself on the test set.  This way you can measure the progress of learning.  This will help prevent overfitting and can define a stopping point when the model is optimized and no longer needs any more iterations.

XGBoost produces a regression model.  In a binary classification model, the predictions will be probabilities that range from 0 < p < 1.  To interpret the prediction for the binary classification, you can set the probability to > .5, etc.

For a multiclass classification, the similar concept of assigning a threshold applies.

## Data Preparation for xgboost

xgboost only takes numeric variables.  We will need to convert categorical variables, like state, into a numeric variable that can be fed into xgboost.  We will convert a dense matrix (few zeroes in the matrix) to a sparse matrix (many zeroes in the matrix).

One method is called **one-hot encoding**. It is a respresentation of a categorical variable as a binary vector.

Let's show you an example.  Suppose you have the following sequence:
  'red','red','green'
  
Represented as an integer:

  0,0,1
  
One Hot Encoding Representation would look like:

  [0,1]
  
  [0,1]
  
  [1,0]

*Note:  When possible, it is ideal to use the data.table instead of the data.frame.  data.table is 100% compliant with data.frames and its performance is much better.*


*Note: You will want to either remove the ID field or NULL it out.*

If the datasets are large and you don't want to spend the time having to retrain the model in the future.  You can save the model.

p_compare <- subplot(p_boruta,p_xgb)

#htmlwidgets::saveWidget(p_compare, "Boruta vs XGBoost Feature Importance.html")

p_compare

```


# Correlation Analysis

Unfortunately, the corrplot package only works with Numeric data fields.  To do a correlation analysis on all other variables, we would probably need to run ANOVA tests.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
M <-cor(explanatory[,sapply(explanatory,is.numeric)])
corrplot(M,method="circle")

M <- cor(explanatory.train[,c("GarageCars","GarageArea")])
corrplot(M,method="circle")

```

#Appendix C.  Preventing Overfitting

There are 4 commonly used methods to prevent overfitting:

1.  Cross-Validation:  Leave one sample out for in-time validation and the rest of the data used for training.

2.  Early Stopping:  Provides guidance on how many iterations before the learner begins to overfit.

3.  Pruning:  Removing nodes which add little predictive power to the model.

4.  Regularization:  Introduces a cost term for bringing more features with the objective function.  

For regularization, for linear regression we want to minimize the RSS (objective function) and we apply a penalty term to the objective function.  
![*CART Example*](W:/Bermuda/Actuarial/SQL Scripts/Kaggle/House Prices/Regularization.png)

Optimizing lambda defines the trade-off between the prediction accuracy of the training sample and prediction accuracy of the hold out sample.
